##Exercise 1 - Currency convertor

Write a java program that:
- Ask the user to type the price for one dollar in Japanese yen.
- The program will allow the user to convert from dollars to yen and vice versa.
- At any point of time the user can request to change the conversion rate.
- The program stops after a sentinel character entry.

Insure user entry validation at all time. No Crashes or unexpected results.
